Dear aspiring rationalists, effective altruists, and other weird people,

This is the very first draft for the very first "Optimal Week". A week long retreat in Germany, to focus on working on your most important projects, whatever they may be (within legal or at least ethical boundaries).

The rough idea:

One week in a nice and quiet location around the beginning of August
probably rural, yet easily accessible by public transit, ideally it would be suitable for morning runs, fires, outdoor yoga sessions, etc.
in Germany, probably near Berlin
15 - 50 participants

You don't need an idea what to work on when you get to the retreat.
You can work on your project alone or in teams.
Your project should not be just a hobby but should either improve the world or yourself.
Learning to juggle because you need it for your next TED talk or an experiment would be ok, learning to juggle because you think juggling would be nice is not.
Good projects might be: Founding a charity/company, building a program/website, organizing a new group/event or saving Canada. 

We are aware that everyones work habits are different and while some people like to work 10h and more in a day, others are done after 4h, some work best between 5am and noon, others between noon and midnight.
All of these are fine; however, if you just want to have a fun vacation and hang out with friends, please do that somewhere else.
There will be entirely optional side activities like: Morning sports, morning planning, yoga, meditation, evening reviews. 

The cost will depend on the location and will include meals and accomodation, presumably it would be around EUR 300 per person.
We might be able to get some financial support from LessWrong Deutschland e.V. to either bring the cost down for everyone, or offer financial aid for participants who have trouble affording it.

There will be more information about cost, location and the explicit date soon.
Write us if you want to help organizing the week (that grants the privilege to bend parts of it to your needs and my eternal gratitude ;)

Write us if you already want to reserve one of the first 10 spots.
(In the tradition of the Less Wrong Community Weekend, more spots will be available closer to the event.)
